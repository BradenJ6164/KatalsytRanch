- Not allowed on furniture 
- Must be crated if left unattended 
- Keep a close eye when outside for their protection

## Outdoor Rules
- Never leave food, drinks or trash outside; these items attract bears and other wildlife; we also recommend locking your car doors if parked outside (bears can be tricky!).
- Close all doors (including the garage door) if not actively using/monitoring to keep critters out.
- Clean the grill after use.
- No parking in front of large garage/shop (we require access on a regular basis).
