# Alarm System
The alarm will disarm when you unlock the door via the August app. If you'd like to use the alarm while visiting, please let us know and we'll assign you a personalized code.

# Climate Control
  ## Heat
Each room has its own electric heating element and can be manually adjusted. They are on a program and will auto adjust based on preset program. Remember, heat rises, so often you won't need the upstairs heating units. We get a lot of solar gain in the house that keeps it toasty, even in the winter.
  ## Air Conditioning
Controlled by the Ecobee smart thermostat in the kitchen.
:::info Window Coverings
Keeping window coverings pulled will help to maintain temp during the day.

# Corn Hole Sets
Feel free to make use of the corn hole boards in the garage; the bags are in a black bag on top of the boards. Please return to the garage when finished. If you're playing on the concrete patio outback, the expansion lines (the one closest to the hottub, and the one outside the door to the pool room) mark regulation distance of 27' with the front of the boards lined up to the line (we're nerds).

**When you're done..Add 1-2 tsp of Renew at the end of each day the spa is used, and then select stir from the control panelRenew is located in the drawer under the top step of to the spaTest strips are provided as well (small blue bottle); due to the nature of well water, it can run high in PH/Alkalinity. If it reads high, put a few tsp of pH down in the tub and select STIR from the control panel.**

# Outdoor Furniture
Cushins for the outdoor furniture are on top of the large storage box in the garage. The property is prone to high gusts of wind. Please tie the lounge cushins down when on the chairs outside. Pro trick - if using the regular sitting chairs, tuck the back cushin under the arm rest to keep them from blowing away so you're not chasing them down the hill. Please ensure they are put back in the garage before checkout.
